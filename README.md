Programming recursive algorithms for "Fibonacci Series" and "Merge Sort"

## Fibonacci Series
Using iteration, write a function 'fibs(n)' which takes a number and returns an array containing the 'n' first numbers from the fibonacci sequence.

Write another method 'fibsRec(n)' which solves the same problem recursively (in 1 or 2 lines if you can).
